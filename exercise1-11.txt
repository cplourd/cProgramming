/* How would you test the word count program?
I would feed the program some inputs and compare the actual output to my expected outputs.
What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?
1) A sequence of numbers would be mistaken as words
2) individual letters would also be counted as words
** The program has no sense of grammar rules
